                    <p>Hello! I’m Bethany. I’m a web developer living in Portland, Maine seeking to support environmental
                    sustainability in my work life. After several years in childhood
                    development, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and it turned out that programming required many similar
                    skills, like problem
                    solving and multi-tasking. As a developer, I want to use code to solve some of the planets’
                    biggest problems.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not working on my web development skills, you can find me in my garden, at a greenhouse
                    or thrifting to find new treasures for my home.</p>

                    <p>I am currently available for full-time work in the New England area or remotely.</p>
